# Kdu CLI

## ⚠️ Status

Kdu CLI is now in maintenance mode. For new projects, please use [create-kdu](https://github.com/kdujs/create-kdu) to scaffold [Wite](https://witejs.web.app/)-based projects, which supports both Kdu 2 and Kdu 3.

Also refer to the latest [Tooling Guide](https://kdu-js.web.app/guide/scaling-up/tooling.html) on setting up a new Kdu 3 project.

## Documentation

Docs are available at https://kdujs-cli.web.app/ - we are still working on refining it and contributions are welcome!
